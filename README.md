# gutils (Garry's Mod addon utilities)
This addon is for things that tend to be remade from addon to addon with the same functionality.
I'm going to be adding to this every time I make something that could be utilised by multiple addons.

I'll redo this readme with how to use stuff at a later date... For now I won't bother as I'm going to remake some things.
